The dataset features various kidney stone images from CT scans, covering different stone sizes, shapes, and positions within the urinary system. Each image is accompanied by marked bounding boxes, making it easier to pinpoint kidney stone locations. Researchers and medical professionals can utilize this dataset to enhance object detection algorithms in medical imaging. It\u0027s also a gateway to telemedicine innovations and the development of AI-powered tools for better kidney stone diagnosis and treatment.\n\uD83D\uDCA1 This dataset has been downloaded from ![https://universe.roboflow.com](https://universe.roboflow.com) which is the world\u0027s largest collection of open source computer vision datasets and APIs.\n\uD83D\uDCA1 License: CC BY 4.0(Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International.)"}
